# GSA-Localconnector — Current checkpoint

Date: 2026-10-16
Stage: P0-01 baseline recorded; PX-01 bootstrap source committed, **tests not yet verified**.

## Resume instructions
1. Read `.gsa/BASELINE.md`, this checkpoint, and `docs/plans/GSA-LOCALCONNECTOR-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`.
2. Inspect HEAD and latest CI runs; do not claim PASS without run evidence.
3. Run `npm install --ignore-scripts && npm test` on Windows and macOS. Fix any TypeScript and test failures.
4. Implement durable trusted workspace registration and MCP transport with direct typed tools only after reviewing security boundaries.
5. Prioritize PX-04/PX-05 native OS isolation prototypes before exposing shell or local CI.

## Committed bootstrap
- TypeScript project and host-neutral contracts.
- Windows/macOS adapter detection; shell isolation and local CI intentionally BLOCKED.
- In-memory trusted workspace read resolver (not a security sandbox and not public enrollment).
- Unit tests for unsupported platform, traversal, symlink escape and grants.
- GitHub Actions cross-platform *source contract* CI, distinct from the future local CI runner.

## Known limitations
- MCP transport, autostart, privileged runtime, persistent registry and local-only CI are not implemented.
- Actual Windows/macOS tests have not yet been observed to PASS.
- No local shell/CI capability is enabled.

## Checkpoint discipline
After each verified ticket, update this file with Git HEAD, exact test results/evidence, blockers and next action. Keep BASELINE immutable. Resume from actual latest evidence, not optimistic status labels.
